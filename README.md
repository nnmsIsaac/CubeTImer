# CubeTimer
A quick Python speed-cube timer that you can use, has basic statistics and editing.

## Installation

# TODO

- Make each action it's own function, then put them into a list with instructions and names. This would remove the nasty if loop and remove some redundncy. plus, if would be way easier to add new features in the future.
