# CubeTimer
A trivially simple Python speed-cube timer that you can use, has basic statistics and editing.

## Installation

- Clone this repo to a folder
- Run `speedcubing.py` with Python 3

Note: This program will save your sessions automatically

## TODO

- Nothing as for right now... a GUI, maybe?
